Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) learning repository!

This repo is a **collection of DSA programs** that I’m writing as part of my daily practice and learning in C. My goal is to **understand core DSA topics**, master problem-solving, and also **help others** who are learning data structures from scratch.

## 📘 What’s Covered So Far

Here’s a breakdown of the topics and the programs I’ve written till now:

- 🧱 *Stack*
  - Stack using Array  
  - Stack using Linked List  
  - Stack Operations: push, pop, peek, isEmpty, isFull  

- 📚 *Queue*
  - Queue using Array  
  - Queue using Linked List  
  - Circular Queue  
  - Deque (Double Ended Queue)  

- 🔗 *Linked List*
  - Singly Linked List (Insertion, Deletion, Traversal)  
  - Doubly Linked List  
  - Circular Linked List  

- 🧮 *Sorting*
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Quick Sort  

- 📐 *Polynomial Operations*
  - Polynomial Representation using Linked List  
  - Polynomial Addition and Multiplication  

- 🧠 *Infix, Prefix, Postfix*
  - Infix to Postfix Conversion  
  - Infix to Prefix Conversion  
  - Postfix Evaluation  
  - Prefix Evaluation  

- 🌲 *Tree*
  - Binary Tree Basics  
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)  
  - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder Traversals  
  - Insertion and Deletion in BST  

- 🕸 *Graph*
  - Graph Representations: Adjacency Matrix & List  
  - BFS (Breadth First Search)  
  - DFS (Depth First Search)  
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Coming Soon)  

*More topics coming soon as I go deeper into DSA!*

## 💡 Who is this for?

- 🧑‍💻 Students learning DSA for the first time  
- 💻 Competitive programmers looking for base templates  
- 🎯 Developers revising DSA fundamentals

## 📅 My Goal

I will **upload codes regularly** based on the topics covered in my tuition and personal learning.  
Each topic contains **multiple example codes** and **clear comments** for easy understanding.

---

## 📬 How to Use

1. Navigate through the folders by topic (e.g., `/Stack`, `/Tree`, `/Graph`, etc.).
2. Open `.c` files and read the comments for logic.
3. Run the code in any C IDE or online compiler.
4. Modify, debug, or enhance for better understanding.
